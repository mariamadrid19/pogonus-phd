# Version 0.4

# Changed the default RC


# Version 0.3

# Matt Olm

# VERSION 0.3 UPDATE
# When very few reads map, it was still determining the read length based on the RC called
# in the beginning. Now, I update RC at the end to become j (which will be RC if that value
# is reached). This effects the start of END


# VERSION 0.2 UPDATE
# NOTE When dealing with buckets, I'm subtracting 1 from the value before dividing. This is
# because the value 3000 belongs in bucket 0, not bucket 1. I'm essentially just making it
# a zero-based value, which is fine because we'll never get a length 0 scaffold or position.
# This effects lines 11 and 20.
